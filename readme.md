A performance dashboard for [EssenceCatalog](github.com/conjure-cp/EssenceCatalog).

The idea of this project is to create an interactive data analytics dashboard to allow users to quickly and easily analyze the performance of different solver configurations on different problem classes. 

There are two broad aspects of this project:

Firstly, to fulfil the primary objectives: to create a set of interactive graphs and plots displaying important comparative information.

Secondly, to fulfil the secondary objectives: to use machine learning to identify anomalies and carry out clustering analysis of the different solutions.
